# CanLaD - Canada Landsat Disturbance ‚Äì Forest Insect Update

This repository contains the code used to generate the results presented in the paper:  
**_Remote Sensing-Based Interannual Monitoring of Major Insect Disturbances in Canadian Forests_** (in review).  
We used **LandTrendr** and the **TempCNN** model to detect forest disturbances across Canada from 1985 to 2024.

## Methodology

1. **Train the TempCNN model**  
   Use `01_Main_Train_Kfold.py`  
   üëâ [Example training dataset](https://github.com/Patawaitte/FoDiM/tree/main/Dataset)

2. **Detect disturbance breaks with LandTrendr**  
   Use `02_LandTrendr_get_breaks.py`

3. **Apply TempCNN model to each break**  
   Run `03_Inference_TempCNN_LTD.py`

4. **Generate annual disturbance maps**  
   Convert outputs using `04_Transform_to_time_series.py`

5. **Apply cleaning with 12-pixel sieve filter**  
   Use `05_sieve_time_series.py`

6. **Extract the latest disturbance type and year**  
   Use `06_Latest_From_Time_Series.py`

üñ•Ô∏è **Note:**  
The entire workflow was executed using the Government of Canada‚Äôs High Performance Computing (HPC) service.  
The TempCNN model has a small memory footprint (<1 MB), making CPU-based inference efficient.  
Canada was divided into ~2,000 tiles (10,000‚ÄØkm¬≤ each) for parallel processing.  
Full processing time: ~2 days.
